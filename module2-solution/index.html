                    <p>Chicken domestication was previously considered 
                        to have occurred in the Indus Valley at around 
                        2000 BC6. However, West and Zhou7 proposed an 
                        earlier origin in Southeast Asia, before the 6000 
                        BC, based on archaeological evidence from China, 
                        Southeast Asia, and Europe, and palaeoclimatic 
                        evidence in China.

                    <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. 
                        Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are 
                        often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying 
                        degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground 
                        or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains 
                        protein, iron, and vitamin B12.

                    <p>The earliest form of sushi, a dish today known as narezushi, 
                        originated in Southeast Asia where it was made to preserve 
                        freshwater fish, possibly in the Mekong River basin, which 
                        is now Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, and in the Irrawaddy 
                        River basin, which is now Myanmar.
